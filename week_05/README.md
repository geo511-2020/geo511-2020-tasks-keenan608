 Vignette: While this doesn't seem to be a function that you would use in an operation
 it is really nice knowing that something exists which can help describe a function,
 basically a built in dictionary - I may know something exists but not exactly how to use it. I do not have a lot of experience in code so something like a built in help function
 really makes the learning process seem less steep. I wish there was something like this
 for python. Between the housing unit of RStudio and the relatively expansive, yet 
 obtainable packages that are available in R make it seem like a much more inviting
 beginner experience than python.
 
 st_as_sf: This is a slightly frustrating in thinking that there are multiple forms
 of spatial data within R. However, the fact that there is an easy transfer between
 the two forms makes it easier to deal with. I find it interesting that the ability
 to convert between St and Sf allows for more manipulation of the dataframe.
 
 plot: This seems like a simple a really simple function but it is really powerful. 
 A function that shows the feature you are working on allows for you to check up with
 data you are working on. While it doesn't offer any ability to layer multiple layers,
 it is a fast and dirty plot function.
