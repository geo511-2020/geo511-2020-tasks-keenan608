 The link in the task was not functioning.
 
 I did watch the video as a way of looking at material related to the casestudy.
 I did find that the AppEEARs was extremely helpful in finding more data that I didn't 
 know was available without having to pay. While the webinar was a little hard to follow. 
 This app seemed relatively easy once you got in. The use of points or other geometric seemed really easy to use.
