 select(): This function within dplyr allows you to subset and select columns within
 a dataframe. This is incredibly useful as you are working on a dataframe that has long
 columns names. This is one of the fundamental functions that would make cleaning data
 really easy. It seems like something that becomes second nature. 
 
 mutate(): This seems a little more powerful than select. It allows for the changing
 of data within the dataframe. This is extremely helpful when you need to make transform
 data while maintaining the dataframe. 
 
 zonal(): The zonal function is an aggregation technique for rasters. Within a predefined
 area, you can aggregate the value of a raster as summary table. This can be used as a 
 way of establishing defined zones.
