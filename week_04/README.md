 Delayed Push:
 
 importing functions like read_csv() is extremely useful because I can then import
 all of the csv's that I have constructed as part of my digitization of archaeological
 site files in UB's Archaeological Survey. 
 
 tidy data chapter: Separate() pulls one column into multiple columns. 
 Thinking along the same example of archaeological site reports, I believe that 
 this function would help in separating the interpretation of each site into multiple colums, particuarlly when there are multiple layers of a site (Prehistoric/Historic)
 
 Relational Data:
 I am struggling to understand the graphics used for different kinds of joins,
 this maybe because I am still think about data that is a single table. This idea
 of making joins makes more sense when I am thinking about it interms of GIS layers,
 like joining census data to tax parcels of a Census block group.
